Hello there. This is the first test of this cool framework called Gatsby.js

## This is pretty cool

Now, you can directly use your custom component within your Markdown files! For instance, if you include the tag:

```html
<interactive-counter></interactive-counter>
```

You'll end up with an interactive component:

<counter></counter>
<sortablelayers> <sortablelayers />

Latex:

$$
\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} \equiv 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }
$$

## Possibilities

Custom components embedded in Markdown enables many features that weren't possible before; here are some ideas, starting simple and getting complex:

- Write a live countdown clock for an event such as Christmas, the Super Bowl, or someone's birthday. Suggested markup: `<countdown-clock> 2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z </countdown-clock>`
- Write a component that displays as a link with an informative hovercard. For example, you might want to write `<hover-card subject="ostrich"> ostriches </hover-card>` to show a link that lets you hover to get information on ostriches.
- If your Gatsby site is for vacation photos, you might write a component that allows you to show a carousel of pictures, and perhaps a map that shows where each photo was taken.
- Write a component that lets you add live code demos in your Markdown, using [component-playground](https://formidable.com/open-source/component-playground/) or something similar.
- Write a component that wraps a [GFM table](/hello-world-kitchen-sink/#tables) and displays the data from the table in an interactive graph.
